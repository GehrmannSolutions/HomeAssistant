# Diorama

A Home Assistant card that turns your home into a small 3D model you can click.

## The diorama

Draw your rooms, furnish them and bind the pieces to your Home Assistant devices. The model shows what your home is doing right now: a lamp glows when its light is on, and a click on it turns it off. Lamps light their room and cast shadows, and the sun moves through the day.

A sharper version of the clip is in [docs/video/demo.mp4](docs/video/demo.mp4).

## Widgets

Diorama comes with its own widgets in the same look as the model. Turn on **Show widgets beside the 3D view** and they appear next to it, one for each device you placed, grouped by room. You can also use them on their own, anywhere on a dashboard.

## The editor

Everything is built inside Home Assistant, in the card's own full-screen editor. The plan sits on top, a live 3D preview below and the catalog on the right. Draw rooms, drop pieces in, drag them, snap them to walls, tweak their style and colors, and pick the entity each one stands for.

## Install

Diorama needs Home Assistant 2024.6 or newer.

1. In Home Assistant open **HACS**, open the three-dot menu in the top right and choose **Custom repositories**.
2. Paste `https://github.com/CarlesRojas/ha-diorama`, pick the **Dashboard** type and add it.
3. Search for **Diorama** in HACS and download it. HACS registers the card's resource for you.
4. Reload the browser.
5. Edit a dashboard, choose **Add card** and search for **Diorama**.

Updates arrive through HACS like any other card. If a new version does not show up after updating, clear the browser cache. The card logs its version in the browser console on load, so a stale copy is easy to spot.

<summary>Install by hand, without HACS</summary>

1. Download `card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/CarlesRojas/ha-diorama/releases/latest) into `config/www/diorama/card.js`.
2. In **Settings > Dashboards**, open the three-dot menu, choose **Resources** and add `/local/diorama/card.js` as a **JavaScript module**.
3. Edit a dashboard, choose **Add card** and search for **Diorama**.

When you update, bump a `?v=` query on the resource URL so browsers pick up the new file.

## Start building

New to the card? This five minute tutorial builds a small home from an empty card: two rooms, a lamp and a fan bound to real devices, a camera view for each room and the side panel.

Or, in short:

1. Add the card to a dashboard and press **Open editor**.
2. Trace your first room on the grid.
3. Open the catalog and drop in a ceiling light and a sofa.
4. Select the light and pick the Home Assistant entity it stands for.
5. Save, then click the light in the card. It lights up, and so does the real one.
