// Switching a lamp on or off changes how many lights the scene has, and
// three builds a shader for every material with the count of each kind of
// light baked in. So the first frame after a switch built a new shader for
// every material in the flat, and for the two the shadow maps are drawn
// with, and linking them stalled the page for anything from a blink to over
// a second, longer on a phone. The lamp seemed to take its time.
//
// Instead a change is tried first: it is made, the shaders the scene would
// then need are asked for, and it is undone again, all before the next frame
// draws. The browser links the shaders in the background, and once they are
// ready the change is made for good, and the frame that follows finds
// everything built. A change that is asked for while another is being tried
// waits for the next round, so a room switching on a dozen lamps at once
// tries them together.
//
// Three can ask for the shaders of the things it draws, but not for the two
// it draws the shadow maps with: those are its own, and they are set up for
// each caster as the maps are drawn. So a stand in for each kind of caster
// is built here, carrying a copy of the shadow material set up the way three
// sets it, and those are asked for on top. They are keyed as three keys the
// shaders, so what is built here is what three will look for.
